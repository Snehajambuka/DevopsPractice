# DOCKER

### Install Docker
------------------- 

* Create a ubuntu 22.04 linux vm in any cloud of your choice
* ssh into it and install docker 
```
 $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sh install-docker.sh
```
After installation execute `sudo docker info` 

* To check what are the groups present we use `cat /etc/group`
* Docker when installed on a linux machine creates a group called `docker` group
* docker client communicates with docker server (docker daemon) on the unix socket which is accessible only to the users of docker group.
* After installation add your user to docker group
```
sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
#exit
#relogin
```
* Now get the docker information using `docker info` to see client as well as server details.
  
### Running our first container
* To run the docker container we need docker image (which has all the necessary stuff packaged to run the application).
* ex- `docker container run hello-world` here hello-world is taken from dockerhub.
* so after excecuting this command first it shows that there no such image named hello-world then it'll download that image .
* then again when we execute the same command it will not download but it will directly run .
* how do i find what are the images present in my local machine - using
`docker image ls`

* Steps
  1. docker contianer run is issued from client
  2. docker daemon checks in the local image store
  3. if not present downloads from registry (docker hub)
  4. runs the container
 
 ### Getting used to docker commands
 * Two ways
  * help. use `--help`
  * cheatsheet
  
### Figure out docker commands
* create a docker network `docker network create`
* ist docker volumes `docker volume ls`
* stop the docker container` docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...`
* remove the docker image`docker image rm`
* build the docker image`docker image build`
* start all the containers using docker compose`docker compose start`
* stop all the containers docker compose`docker compose stop`
